## How it works

    testing purposes. To access company resources from this network, you must be
    connected to the FortiClient VPN.
* **AV Room Computers:** Each audio-visual conference room has a dedicated PC.
    You must use these specific credentials to log into them for setup or
    troubleshooting.

    and other sensitive items.
