# Welcome to the Service Desk


## Overview

This page provides a high-level summary of the Service Desk's role at FSRA.
As a member of this team, you are the first point of contact for all IT-related
support, making your role crucial to the productivity of the entire organization.

## Core Responsibilities

Your primary responsibilities involve managing the IT needs of all FSRA employees
through our ticketing system, Cherwell, and our call center software, Five9. You will handle a wide range of tasks,
including:

* **Incident Management:** Resolving technical issues with hardware, software,
    and network access.
* **Request Fulfillment:** Fulfilling service requests for new hardware,
    software installations, and access permissions.
* **Asset Management:** Tracking, assigning, and managing the lifecycle of IT
    assets like laptops, monitors, and mobile devices.
* **Onboarding & Offboarding:** Preparing technology for new hires and
    reclaiming assets from departing employees.

## How We Work

The Service Desk operates on a ticket-based system. All user requests and
reported issues are logged as tickets in Cherwell. It is your responsibility to
acknowledge, manage, and resolve these tickets in a timely and professional
manner. You will use a variety of tools, including Active Directory, SCCM, and
Remote Desktop, and the Five9 softphone, to perform your duties.
