# Your Accounts & Credentials

## Overview

This page details the user accounts you will use daily and explains the critical
process for password synchronization. Understanding this is key to avoiding
account lockouts for yourself and other users.

## Your two accounts

You will be assigned two primary accounts:

1.  **Standard User Account:** Your day-to-day account for email, Teams, and
    general use.
    * **Username Format:** First letter of your first name, followed by the
        first seven letters of your last name (e.g., Sarah Joo -> `sjoo`).
    * **Email Format:** `firstname.lastname@fsrao.ca`.

2.  **Service Desk Admin Account (`sdesk_`)**: Your privileged account used for
    administrative tasks in tools like Active Directory and Remote Desktop.
    * **Username Format:** `sdesk_` followed by your standard username (e.g.,
        `sdesk_sjoo`).

<Warning>
Always use your standard account for general work. Only use the `sdesk_`
account when performing administrative tasks that require elevated
privileges. 
</Warning>

## Password policy & synchronization

Your standard account password is used for Windows, FortiClient VPN, and all
Microsoft 365 sign-ins. Keeping it synchronized is critical.

### Password complexity requirements

All passwords must meet the following criteria to be accepted by the system:

* **Minimum Length:** At least **12 characters**.
* Must contain 3 out of the 4 character types
    * **Uppercase:** At least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
    * **Lowercase:** At least one lowercase letter (a-z).
    * **Numbers:** At least one number (0-9).
    * **Special Characters:** At least one special character (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`).
* **History:** Cannot be one of the last 5 passwords used.

### Password synchronization quick-start

When you or a user changes a password, it must be synchronized correctly.

1.  **If you are in the office:** You must be connected to the `FSRA-WIFI`
    network when you change your password. This allows the change to sync
    instantly with the domain controllers.

2.  **If you are working remotely:** In order for synchornization to proceed, you must be connected to the FSRA VPN. To synchronize a password that was changed or reset while offline, the user must first establish a connection to the domain controllers. See [Self Service Password Reset] for more details.
