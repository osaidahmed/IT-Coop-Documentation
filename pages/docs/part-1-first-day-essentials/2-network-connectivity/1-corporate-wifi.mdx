# Corporate & Guest Wi-Fi

## Overview

This page provides instructions for connecting to FSRA's primary wireless
networks. `FSRAO-WIFI` is the secure, internal network for employee devices,
while `FSRAO-GUEST` is for all non-FSRA devices and visitors.

## Connecting to FSRAO-WIFI (Corporate Network)

This is the primary network for all work-related activities. The connection
method differs between domain-joined laptops and mobile devices.

### FSRA Laptops

Your FSRA-issued laptop connects to `FSRAO-WIFI` automatically. It is part of
the domain and requires no manual setup.

### Mobile Phones & Non-Domain Devices

You must manually connect personal or non-domain devices using your FSRA
network credentials.

<Note> 
Turn Off Mobile Data
Before connecting your phone, ensure that Mobile Data and/or Personal Hotspot
are turned off to prevent connection issues.
</Note>
#### **Connecting an Android Device**

1.  Navigate to `Settings > Connections > Wi-Fi`.
2.  Select `FSRAO-WIFI` from the list of available networks.
3.  Configure the connection settings as follows:
    * **EAP method:** `PEAP`
    * **Identity:** Your full work email address (e.g., `omar.saidahmed@fsrao.ca`)
    * **Password:** Your current Windows login password.
    * **CA certificate:** Select `Don't validate`. You can ignore any privacy warnings.
4.  Click **Connect**.

#### **Connecting an iOS Device**

1.  Navigate to `Settings > Wi-Fi`.
2.  Select `FSRAO-WIFI` from the list of "Other Networks".
3.  Enter your credentials when prompted:
    * **Username:** Your full work email address (e.g., `omar.saidahmed@fsrao.ca`)
    * **Password:** Your current Windows login password.
4.  Click **Join**.
5.  A certificate prompt will appear. Tap **Trust** in the top-right corner to
    complete the connection.

#### **After a Password Change**

When you change your Windows password, you must update it on your mobile devices.
The Wi-Fi may appear connected but will lack internet access.

* **Android:** The system will not prompt you. You must "forget" the
    `FSRAO-WIFI` network and reconnect using the steps above with your new
    password.
* **iOS:** Open a work application like Teams or Outlook. You will be prompted
    to re-enter your password. Once you sign in, network access will be restored.

## Connecting to FSRAO-GUEST (Guest Network)

The guest network is for non-FSRA devices and visitors. It requires a quick
self-registration process.

### Quick-start

1.  Select `FSRAO-GUEST` from the list of available networks. No password is
    required to join.
2.  A captive portal (login page) should open automatically. If it doesn't, open
    a web browser and try to navigate to any site.
3.  On the portal page, click the link that says **"Do you require access to FSRA Guest-WiFi? Click Here"**.
4.  Complete the **Self-Registration** form with your full name, phone number,
    and a personal email address. Accept the terms and click **Register**.
5.  You will receive your guest credentials (username and password) via the email
    and phone number you provided.
6.  Return to the portal's main login screen, enter the credentials you just
    received, accept the terms, and click **Log In**.
<Note>
30-Day Access

Guest access is valid for 30 days on up to two devices. After logging in once,
your device should reconnect automatically for the duration of the access period.
