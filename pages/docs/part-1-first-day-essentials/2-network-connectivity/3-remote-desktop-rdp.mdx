# Remote Desktop (RDP)

<hr className="my-4 border-slate-600"/>

## Overview

This page explains how to connect to the primary administrative server (`grds-01`)
using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). You will use this connection to access
core management tools like Active Directory and SCCM.

## Prerequisites

* You must be connected to the FSRA corporate network, either directly in the
    office or via the [VPN (FortiClient)](./2-vpn-forticlient.mdx).
* You need your Service Desk Admin (`sdesk_`) account credentials.

## Quick-start

1.  Open the **Remote Desktop Connection** application on your computer.
2.  In the `Computer` field, enter `grds-01`.
3.  Click **Connect**.
4.  When prompted for credentials, select **More choices** > **Use a different account**.
5.  Enter your Service Desk Admin username (e.g., `FSRAO\sdesk_sjoo`) and your
    corresponding password.
6.  Click **OK** to establish the connection.
<Warning>
  Your `sdesk_` admin account is protected by Microsoft Authenticator 2FA. When
  using it for administrative actions (e.g., on another user's laptop or via RDP),
  you will be periodically prompted for a 6-digit OTP.

  This authentication prompt can sometimes be buggy and cause the "Enter
  Credentials" screen to freeze. If this happens, press `Ctrl+Alt+Del` to escape.
  After escaping, you might see one of two outcomes:
  1. The OTP screen appears correctly. If so, enter the code to proceed.
  2. You are returned to your desktop with no new window. If so, re-initiate the
     admin action and repeat the `Ctrl+Alt+Del` escape process until the OTP
     prompt appears.
</Warning>
## How it works

Remote Desktop gives you a virtual desktop session on the `grds-01` server. This
server hosts the administrative consoles for many of our core systems. By
connecting to it, you can manage users and devices without installing these
tools directly on your own laptop.


## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                                     | Likely Cause                                                              | Fix                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer..."    | Not connected to the corporate network or a typo in the server name.      | Verify your connection status in the FortiClient VPN app. Ensure the computer name is exactly `grds-01` with no extra spaces.                                   |
| "The logon attempt failed."                                 | Incorrect password or using the wrong account format.                     | Re-enter your password carefully. Ensure you are using your `sdesk_` account and have specified the domain: `FSRAO\sdesk_username`.                             |
