# Introduction

Hello there, future Service Desk co-op. I’m a current Service Desk co-op student, and I built this documentation site piece by piece to share the know-how I’ve gathered. When I first started, it was pretty jarring. On the first day, I was immediately put to dealing with tickets with almost no idea what I was doing. Thankfully, after a week or so, everything became simple and repetitive. But I realized my supervisors were spending an unnecessary amount of time teaching and that a surprising number of avoidable mistakes cropped up during that period. As the Service Desk software itself is fairly straightforward, it’s definitely possible to learn the “know-how” from solid documentation—often even more effectively than through verbal instructions alone. That’s why I made this: to reduce the onboarding load on supervisors and provide a more accessible source for incoming co-ops.

Additionally, this documentation site offers more than just onboarding content. It dives into the many aspects you’ll encounter on the job, providing quick-reference details for common scenarios. If you open a ticket and aren’t sure where to begin, check here first. Can’t find what you need? Talk to your supervisors to learn how to tackle and resolve the issue, then add that information to these pages. I intend this to serve as a living “Wiki” for the Service Desk. Instructions for editing any page can be found in the sidebar.
This page is organized into several key sections that cover everything from foundational concepts to the tools required for daily support work:

- **Purpose of This Documentation**  
  Explains what this guide is for (and what it’s not), so co-ops can jump straight to the right information without endless searching.  
- **Importance of Asset Management**  
  Dives deep into why tracking hardware, software, and licenses is critical for team efficiency, compliance, and budgeting.  
- **Key Responsibilities**  
  Breaks down the day-to-day duties—ticket handling in Cherwell, phone support via Five9, and criteria for escalation to specialized teams.  
- **Working Dynamics**  
  Explains how the Service Desk interacts with system engineers, network engineers, and the collaboration team, highlighting their distinct responsibilities and how they fit together—plus a nod to the ever-entertaining world of VPN troubleshooting.  
- **Common Issues**  
  Catalogs the most frequent support requests, ensuring quick reference for everything from password resets to audio-visual quirks.  
- **Tools**  
  Introduces Active Directory and Microsoft Configuration Manager, detailing their roles in maintaining efficient support operations.

<Note>
This site is not a substitute for formal IT training or a personal notebook, nor is it the end-all, be-all for every error or tool that might be encountered. It focuses on delivering quick, reliable information for the most common FSRA support issues.

## Purpose of This Documentation

This living knowledge base brings together essential procedures, troubleshooting steps, and best practices into one centralized location. It serves as the first-stop reference for everyday FSRA support tasks—ticket management, basic network diagnostics, and more—reducing the need for repeated handoffs or scattered searches. While it covers core workflows in depth, it does not attempt to catalog every possible error message or obscure tool; rather, it provides clear, concise guidance for the support scenarios most often encountered.

## The Importance of Asset Management

Accurate asset management is the backbone of an efficient IT team. When each laptop, phone, and software license is meticulously tracked—who has it, when it was issued, and when it will be returned or refreshed—the organization gains complete visibility into its inventory. This level of oversight prevents surprises during audits, eliminates time wasted searching for missing equipment, and ensures that users always have the necessary tools to perform their tasks effectively.

Beyond basic inventory tracking, robust asset management underpins smarter budgeting and lifecycle planning. Monitoring usage patterns, warranty expirations, and software license renewals enables the IT team to forecast refresh cycles, negotiate favorable vendor agreements, and retire outdated hardware before failure. In regulated environments, detailed asset records also support compliance by demonstrating that licenses are current and security updates are applied promptly.

<Tip>
Log every device in Cherwell immediately upon issuance or retirement. This simple habit today prevents major headaches tomorrow.

## Key Responsibilities

New Service Desk co-ops are responsible for three primary functions. The first is ticket management in Cherwell, where each ticket serves as a digital record of a user request or incident. The second is phone support via Five9, guiding callers through documented solutions and capturing details for follow-up. The third involves assisting with advanced IT tasks, gathering necessary information to escalate issues to specialized teams when front-line support isn’t sufficient.

## Working Dynamics

Interactions with specialized engineering teams are a core part of daily operations. Each group covers a distinct domain:

- **System Engineers** manage advanced configurations, server infrastructure, and software deployments. 
- **Network Engineers** design, implement, and maintain network architecture, ensuring connectivity, performance, and (what is most important to you) VPN's 
- **Collaboration Team** oversees unified communication platforms—such as SharePoint. 

Service Desk co-ops act as the first point of contact, diagnosing issues, applying standard solutions, and escalating to the appropriate team when deeper expertise is required.

## Common Issues You’ll Encounter

Service Desk co-ops regularly address password resets, account lockouts, software updates, and basic network connectivity problems. Additional tasks may include printer and scanner setups, audio-visual equipment troubleshooting, and minor hardware diagnostics. This variety ensures that every day brings new learning opportunities and keeps the role engaging.

## Tools

**Active Directory** enables management of user accounts and groups, allowing rapid password resets and account unlocks.  
**Microsoft Configuration Manager** provides remote access to user devices, facilitating software deployments, updates, and troubleshooting directly from the desk.
